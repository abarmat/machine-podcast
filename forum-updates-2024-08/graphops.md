## üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Executive Summary

We are excited to share the latest updates and advancements across our workstreams, bringing new features and enhacements to the community.

In [GraphSeer](https://graphseer.com/), our team has been working on a new backend that calculates average statistics for Delegators, setting the stage for smooth integration with the frontend. We're also enhancing the overall developer experience with improvements to the local development environment and CI/CD processes. Plus, stay tuned for the **upcoming GraphSeer account feature** :eyes:, which will soon be available in the app! Other recent updates include autopagination for queries, along with SEO and styling improvements that will be available soon in the app.

Launchpad has seen some great updates as well! We've rolled out chart enhancements and introduced a new component: [Launchpad Taskfiles](https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-taskfiles). This new component allows us to modularize predefined Indexer tasks and ship them to users of Launchpad seamlessly. We‚Äôve also updated stable namespaces across multiple blockchains.

For Network Operations, our efforts have led to the successful implementation of a consumer for all Kafka topics in the QoS Oracle V2 and the orchestration of a comprehensive testing environment. We also have been working on a new processing pipeline, and on an IPFS Publishing pipeline. Additionally, we‚Äôve refactored SMART to operate within the decentralized network.

Happy September everyone ‚ú®

## :tada: Looking Back (what was delivered)

### GraphSeer ([Launch the app](https://graphseer.com), [Learn more](https://graphops.xyz/our-work/graphseer-explorer))

* Continued significant codebase improvements that are near completion
* Implemented GraphSeer account (soon in the app!)
* Implemented autopagination for queries which allows us to display complete data for deployments and allocations SEO and styling improvements
* Bug fixes 
    * Indexers with no allocations or performance data missing and 
    * ENS name for Subgraph Deployment Allocations table
    * Deployments with no allocations
* Backend work for average statistics for Delegators, yet to be included in the frontend
* Enhancing developer experience
* Local developer environment development
* Improved CI/CD

### Launchpad ([Documentation](https://docs.graphops.xyz/launchpad/intro), [Starter](https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-starter), [Charts](https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-charts), [Namespaces](https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces))

* Added a new Launchpad component: [launchpad-taskfiles](https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-taskfiles), which implements [remote taskfiles](https://taskfile.dev/experiments/remote-taskfiles/) thus modularizing our taskfiles out of [launchpad-starter](https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-starter/pull/48/files)
* Introduction of metric relabelings for better accuracy in Arbitrum service monitors and added functionality to proxyd, alongside fixes in Lighthouse service for improved reliability
* Chart updates for Erigon, Arbitrum-Nitro, Subgraph-Radio, Listener-Radio, Lighthouse, Celo, Nimbus, Generic-App Proxyd all with stable releases
* New stable namespaces versions of Ethereum, Gnosis, Polygon, Arbitrum, Celo, Graph, Monitoring, Ingress, Postgres-Operator
* Pre-release version of graph-network-indexer chart, with support for TAP agent and new indexer-service version out
* Pre-release version of firehose-evm chart (chart for all fireeth based chains)
* We have changed the format of Launchpad Office Hours: We decided to move to hosting launchpad related session on an ad-hoc basis in IOH and have an additional Launchpad watch biweekly IOH segment
