### Summary

August was a highly productive month for the Messari team, as we successfully delivered 12 new subgraphs, bringing our total to over 150.

This month also marked the start of our first Solana subgraph development. Collaborating closely with Substreams team, we tackled critical issues, including challenges with indexing speed. Thanks to these efforts, we're now on track to deliver the Orca subgraph in time for the Solana Breakpoint event.

Additionally, Messari hosted a session during The Graph’s Office Hour, where we showcased a real-world example of how the GMX subgraph was built.
