## üë©‚ÄçüöÄ Summary

August was a very productive month for the Pinax team! 

As we [prepare to sunset our dfuse hosted service for EOS and WAX](https://eosnation.io/old-dfuse-tech-discontinued-new-antelope-services-available/), we‚Äôve been working with dfuse users to prepare them to migrate to new EOS and WAX Subgraphs on The Graph and our new Token API, bringing support for WAX and EOS subgraphs on The Graph for the first time. We also shared our first [prototype of Datasets for Ethereum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uCKsON1Rz4c8y-SGydKRsFf1slh_Q_KuvU2LNX2t4GY/edit#heading=h.xx7kjzdxf096) with a handful of prospective customers, added support for 13 new chains and improvements and upgrades to a whole bunch more. And those are just some of the highlights - read on for more!

### Collaboration with core developers and new consumers on designing and testing new data services while augmenting the Indexer experience with new tooling

**Datasets (parquet files)**
- We‚Äôve shared our first [prototype of Datasets for Ethereum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uCKsON1Rz4c8y-SGydKRsFf1slh_Q_KuvU2LNX2t4GY/edit#heading=h.xx7kjzdxf096) with a handful of prospective customers and are in the process of gathering feedback.
- We‚Äôve [produced documentation on plans for verified datasets](https://github.com/pinax-network/substreams-raw-blocks/blob/main/docs/verifying_ethereum_firehose_blocks.md) based on conversations with Semiotic.
- We participated in good discussions with Edge & Node, Semiotic, and The Graph Foundation on using nozzle for datasets.

**Token API**
- Began preparing our dfuse users to migrate to the first version of our Antelope Transaction API and Token API.
- Split use cases by level of detail: recent, more detailed in graph-node ([Antelope Transactions Subgraph](https://github.com/pinax-network/subgraph-antelope-transactions)); Long term, less detailed in ClickHouse ([Antelope Transactions API](https://github.com/pinax-network/antelope-transactions-api) and [Antelope Token API](https://github.com/pinax-network/antelope-token-api))


## :rocket: Looking ahead (upcoming priorities)

- Pinax team members attending Token2049 and Solana breakpoint in Singapore.
- Continuing our Solana ecosystem scan and outreach campaign.

- More videos and blog content.

### Collaboration with core developers and new consumers on designing and testing new data services while augmenting the Indexer experience with new tooling

**Datasets (parquet files)**
- Exploring toolchain.
- Documenting plans/ideas for sharing to get feedback.
- We‚Äôre in the process of developing [Solana Raw Blocks schema using Substreams](https://github.com/pinax-network/substreams-raw-blocks).

**Token API**
- Working on documenting plans.
- Migrating dfuse users to our Antelope Token API and Transaction Subgraphs.

**Billing (thegraph.market)**
