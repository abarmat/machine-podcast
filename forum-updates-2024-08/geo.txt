## 👩‍🚀 Summary

We're continuing to work towards launch. We've made some big changes to the knowledge graph standard to implement a property graph model where facts can be asserted on Relations. We've had to do a big refactor to accommodate that but we're glad that we got this change into the spec. We'll be sharing the draft spec soon.

We've implemented Collections with ordered lists. Changed the onboarding flow. Added more advanced templates.

Getting ready to onboard the next cohort and then move towards launch.
